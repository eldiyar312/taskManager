## Environment variables

You can run a project in several modes, depending on the mode, one or another backend will be used.

Available env modes:

- `local` (default in watch mode)
- `staging`
- `production`

You can run a project in any of the listed modes. To do this, create a file `.env.local` in the root of the package (**note that this file should be ignored by the `git`**) and put the line `PUBLIC_ENV` in it. For example:

```sh
echo "PUBLIC_ENV=staging" >> .env
```

For details see [code](src/constants/env.ts) and [dotenv-flow documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-flow).

## Pre requirements

- `node.js`: `18.*`
- `yarn`: `1.22.*`
- [be-db](../be-db/README.md) (local only) or MongoDB instance (production only)
- [shared](../shared/README.md) (local only)

## Development

1. install `node`, `yarn`
2. run `yarn install`
3. run [be-db](../be-db/README.md)
4. run parallel:

```sh
yarn run watch:po
```

```sh
yarn run db:migrate up
yarn run watch
```

## Production

Just merge the changes into the `main` branch.

### Manual deploy

1. run `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`
2. run `yarn run build:po`
3. run `yarn run build`
4. run `NODE_ENV=production yarn run db:migrate up`
5. run `NODE_ENV=production yarn run start`

## How to check?

Send a GET request to `/` â†’ the response will be "version: x.x.x"
